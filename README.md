# what is it?

This is WIP to prepare an AGENTS.md for Cockpit or actually the cockpit-starter kit.
It should provide the required context for AI assisted coding of new applications
and make sure they follow the project standards.

# how to use it?

Ideally clone the starter-kit repo 
```
git clone https://github.com/cockpit-project/starter-kit.git
```
then copy the AGENTS.md into it. Start your favorite code assistant
and tell it to "read AGENTS.md and follow its guidelines".
